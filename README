## Image database

Image database comprises 377 images of Brazilian license plates acquired at the entrance gate of the [Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP)](http://www.ufop.br) and 345 images of Greek license plates available by [Anagnostopoulos et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2008.922938)  All images in the database have the bounding box of the license plate annotated.  The database can be downloaded from http://www.decom.ufop.br/menotti/imgs-vlpl.
